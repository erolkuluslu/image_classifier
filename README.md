This project provides a comprehensive solution for image processing, smart cropping, image embeddings, feature extraction, dataset cleaning, and model training and inference using PyTorch. Additionally, it includes a Gradio-based web application for easy interaction with the trained model.

## Features

- **Conda Environment**: Manage dependencies and environment configuration with Conda.
- **Image Processing**: Load and filter images efficiently.
- **Smart Cropping**: Automatically detect and crop images using SIFT key points.
- **Image Embeddings**: Extract image embeddings using Img2Vec.
- **Feature Extraction**: Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering.
- **Dataset Manual Cleaning**: Tools for cleaning and organizing datasets.
- **Torch Model Training**: Train custom models using PyTorch.
- **Model Inference**: Make predictions with trained models.
- **Web App**: Interact with the model via a Gradio-based web application.
